"""APScheduler integration for the ccguard anomaly tick (Plan 02-03).

Thin factory + lifecycle helpers over :class:`AsyncIOScheduler`. The scheduler
lives inside the FastAPI event loop (registered in ``main._lifespan``) and runs
the per-machine anomaly evaluation hourly, with a 30-second first-tick so
developers see output shortly after server boot.

Test-safety: the FastAPI lifespan checks :func:`is_disabled` before starting
the scheduler. Setting ``CCGUARD_DISABLE_SCHEDULER=1`` (done unconditionally
in ``tests/conftest.py``) keeps ``TestClient`` from booting the scheduler
thread — otherwise the in-process AsyncIOScheduler would race with the test
event loop and occasionally hang teardown.

Locked config choices (per plan 02-03):

* ``timezone="UTC"``  — finding dedup keys on the UTC date.
* ``IntervalTrigger(hours=1)`` — first tick at ``now + 30s``, hourly afterward.
* ``coalesce=True`` + ``max_instances=1`` — if the host is slow / sleeping, we
  collapse missed runs into one and never overlap ticks.
* ``shutdown(wait=False)`` — never block FastAPI shutdown on a running tick.
